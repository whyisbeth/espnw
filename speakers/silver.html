				<h3>Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer<br/>
					National Basketball Association</h3>
				<p>Through his business and leadership skills, Adam Silver has helped to establish the NBA as one of the world’s preeminent sports leagues, as a model for global sports marketing organizations, and as one of the largest providers of sports programming in the world. </p>
				<p>Silver became NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer in July 2006 after his appointment was unanimously approved by the NBA Board of Governors. He assumed his role as the league’s second-in-command following more than eight years as President and COO, NBA Entertainment.   </p>
				<p>Silver has been instrumental in many league accomplishments, including playing a key role in the negotiations of the league’s last two television agreements, the last three collective bargaining agreements with the NBA Players Association, the development of the WNBA and NBA Development League, the partnership with Turner Broadcasting to jointly manage the NBA’s digital assets, the formation of iHoops – a partnership with the NCAA on a wide-ranging initiative aimed at enhancing youth basketball programs in the U.S., and the creation of NBA China as a separately incorporated operating entity.</p>
				<p>During Silver's tenure, the NBA has seen rapid expansion of its digital activities as NBA Entertainment launched NBA TV – the league’s 24-hour television channel – and developed the NBA.com network, which consists of more than 60 unique websites, including NBA.com, WNBA.com, NBADLeague.com, team sites for the three leagues, and 11 international sections of NBA.com. Silver also oversees the NBA’s and WNBA’s game telecasts, which are carried in 215 countries and territories in 47 languages.</p>
				<p>NBA Entertainment’s Global Merchandising Group – responsible for the product development, merchandising, licensing, sales development, e-commerce, retail, and direct-to-consumer initiatives of the NBA and WNBA – has seen record growth during Silver’s tenure, and sales of NBA and WNBA merchandise exceeded $3 billion at retail last year. Also under Silver’s supervision are the Global Media Properties and Marketing Partnerships divisions, as well as the advertising sales of the league’s extensive media inventory. </p>
				<p>Silver has consistently been named one of the 100 Most Influential People in Sports by BusinessWeek, the Sporting News and the SportsBusiness Journal. He has also been recognized by Time Magazine and CNN on their list of Global Business Influentials, which features 20 of the world’s leading corporate executives. </p>
				<p>Silver joined the NBA in 1992 and previously served under Commissioner Stern as Special Assistant to the Commissioner; NBA Chief of Staff; Senior Vice President and COO, NBA Entertainment; and President and COO, NBA Entertainment. </p>
				<p>Prior to joining the NBA, Silver was a litigation associate at the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he concentrated on media and antitrust cases. He also served as a law clerk to Federal District Court Judge Kimba Wood in New York City.</p>
				<p>In addition to serving on the boards of NBA China, iHoops, The Partnership at <a href="http://www.drugfree.org" rel="external">Drugfree.org</a>, the Lustgarten Foundation, and the Duke University Library, Mr. Silver was appointed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg to the New York City Sports Development Corporation. He is also a member of the University of Chicago Law School Visiting Committee. </p>
				<p>Silver graduated from Duke University and the University of Chicago Law School. He resides in New York City.</p>
