				<p>Elly Deutch launched her career in professional sports marketing, working as the Marketing and New Media Manager for the first ever Women’s Professional Soccer team in Chicago, the Chicago Red Stars. Challenged with the launch of a new professional sports team in an  economic downturn, Elly transformed the face of the Red Stars by creating, executing and successfully programming both traditional and new marketing strategies to help establish the team. Elly continued her work as a consultant to various U.S. Women’s National Team players throughout the World Cup, such as Megan Rapinoe and Kate Markgraf. Afterwards, she entered the PR agency world, where she worked as a digital strategist and community manager for global and national brands such as Kraft, Mars, Motorola, and Nestle. She built and executed various digital campaigns/ sponsorships/events with sport greats like Chad Ochocinco, Jerome Bettis, Tony Dungy, Antonio Freeman and more.</p>
				<p>Elly is now the Co-Founder and Chief Digital Strategist of her company, Blitz Branding LLC.
