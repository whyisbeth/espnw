				<h3>Chairman BBH US</h3>
				<p>A graduate of Oxford University in the UK, Emma spent the early years of her advertising career at various London agencies - big and small, good and bad - before finding her ‘spiritual home’ at BBH in 1993.  She worked at BBH as a strategic planner, responsible for consumer research and  brand/communication strategy, until assuming overall business leadership for a third of the agency’s accounts in early 1998.</p>
				<p>Emma moved to the U.S. in 1999 as Director of Strategic Planning for BBH’s new office in New York. She was part of the office leadership team that grew the agency from three people, a telephone and some sadly wilting potted plants, into the 185?person (and plant-free) shop it is today.</p>
				<p>In 2003 Emma took on the role of Global Director of Strategic Planning, assuming overarching responsibility for BBH’s strategic output across its six offices in Europe, Asia and the Americas,  as well as personal involvement in client accounts such as Sprite, Unilever and British Airways. The author of the global strategy for brands like Vaseline, Emma helped BBH New York attain “planning fame,” in the form of awards like the Jay Chiat Planning Grand Prix and a Global Gold EFFIE.</p>
				<p>A 2003 AdAge “Woman to Watch’, Emma was then recognized in the Spring of 2008 by the Advertising Women of New York with its “Changing the Game” award for driving innovation.   She now serves as Chairman of BBH US and sits on the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) Agency Advisory Board, and in her spare time is a supporter/advisor to the teen/older children adoption Not-For-Profit organization YouGottaBelieve.</p>
				<p>Emma unfortunately does not have a history of proud personal sporting achievements to share with this illustrious group, her athletic prowess having dwindled fast after a very early and glorious peak when she beat all the boys in her class in a 50-yard sprint, aged 7.    She is, however, a passionate and constantly curious observer of human attitudes and behavior, and has been fascinated to learn more about the challenges in the area of women and sports.</p>
