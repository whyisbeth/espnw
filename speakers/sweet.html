					NCAA Senior Vice President, Retired<br />
					UC San Diego, Director of Athletics Emerita</h3>
				<p>Judy Sweet joined the NCAA as Vice President for Championships and Senior Woman Administrator in January 2001.  In 2003, she was promoted to Senior Vice President for Championships and Education Services.  Judy retired from the NCAA in September 2006 and returned to San Diego. She now serves on several boards, is doing Title IX consulting work nationally for universities and organizations, and is Co-Director of the recently established Alliance of Women Coaches.</p>
				<p>Prior to her work with the NCAA, Judy served as Director of Athletics at the University of California, San Diego beginning in 1975, when she became one of the first women in the nation selected to direct a combined men's and women's intercollegiate athletics program, until 1999 when she returned to a faculty position in Social Sciences at UC San Diego.  During her 24 year tenure as athletics director, the UCSD Athletics Program involved 23 varsity teams. From 1981 until 1999, UCSD athletics teams won 26 NCAA National Championships, 32 additional teams were National Finalists and 28 other teams had third place national finishes.  In 1998, UCSD received the NACDA Directors Cup for being the most successful athletics program in NCAA Division III.</p>
				<p>A native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Judy is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where she served as president of the Women's Recreation Association and national president of the Athletic and Recreation Federation of College Women.  She earned a Master's of Science Degree from the University of Arizona, Tucson and a Master's of Business Administration degree from National University, San Diego.  Prior to her faculty appointment at UC San Diego in 1973, she taught and coached at the University of Arizona and Tulane University.</p>
				<p>Judy was elected to a two-year term as President of the NCAA in January 1991 and was Secretary-Treasurer of the NCAA from 1989 to 1991, becoming the first woman to serve in each of those positions.  She was Division III Vice President, the presiding officer of that division, from 1986-88.  Her presidential responsibilities included presiding over the NCAA Administrative Committee, Council, and Executive Committee, and at the NCAA Annual Convention.  She chaired the NCAA Budget Committee and the Special Advisory Committee to Review Recommendations Regarding Distribution of Revenues.  That committee was formed as a result of the successful negotiations with CBS Television personnel, which resulted in a seven-year television contract beginning in 1991, worth $1 Billion.  Judy also served as a member of the Negotiating Committee for that TV contract.</p>
				<p>Judy's other NCAA Committee service was extensive having served on more than twenty committees, including the Subcommittee to Review Minority Opportunities in Intercollegiate Athletics and the Gender Equity Task Force.  In addition, she has served on various local, state, and national committees including the Board of Directors of the National Association of College Women Athletics Administrators (serving as president 2000-2001), the Board of Directors of the National Association of College Directors of Athletics and the Board of Trustees for The United States Sports Academy.  She was a member of the United States Olympic Committee's Task Force on Minorities, and serves on the Board of Trustees of National University.</p>
				<p>Judy's biography appears in several editions of Who's Who, and in 1984 she was selected as an Outstanding Young Woman of America. Her other honors are numerous.  In 1990 the Los Angeles Times selected her as the Top Southern California College Sports Executive of the 80’s.  In 1992 the National Association of College Women Athletic Administrators named Judy Administrator of the Year and she received the W. S. Bailey Award from the Touchdown Club of Auburn-Opelika as the nation's distinguished athletic administrator.

Corbett Memorial Award, which is presented annually to the collegiate administrator who "through the years has most typified Corbett's devotion to intercollegiate athletics and worked unceasingly for its betterment."  In 2006 Judy was named the first NACWAA Legacy Honoree and in 2007 she was named by the Institute for International Sport as one of the 100 Most Influential Sports Educators in America. In 2009 Judy was inducted into the Wisconsin State Sports Hall of Fame.
