				<h3>Co-Director, Collegiate Athlete Premedical Experience (CAPE)<br/>
					Deputy Director, The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke</h3>
				<p>Dr. Henry S. Friedman is an internationally renowned academic adult and pediatric neuro-oncologist who co-founded and manages the world’s largest brain tumor research center, The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University.  He is the author of more than 500 peer reviewed articles, reviews, and book chapters and has presented extensively at both international and national meetings.</p>
				<p>Dr. Friedman has proven experience in drug development working with leaders in the pharmaceutical industry, Food and Drug Administration, National Cancer Institute and advocacy groups.  He is a seasoned innovator and team builder who has built organization cultures for new products and therapy development.  He is an expert connector with a network of decision makers in a broad spectrum of industries including financial/banking, healthcare, health insurance, sports media, federal, legal and political.</p>
				<p>Dr. Friedman is a committed educator who is a member of the Executive and Super Executive Committees of Duke Medical School which is responsible for the recruitment, screening and selection of medical students.  He has reviewed grants for the National Institutes of Health for over 15 years in a spectrum of different study sections.  He is the senior editor of CNS Oncology, the Associate Editor for the Neuro-Oncology Section of Cancer and is a reviewer for over 25 academic journals.</p>
				<p>However Dr. Friedman is perhaps most proud for his role as the creator and co-director of the Collegiate Athlete Premedical Experience (CAPE) which he started at Duke University with Dr. Allan Friedman in 1999.  This is a mentoring program devoted to female undergraduate varsity athletes who seek admission to medical school.  Seventy-five students have graduated from CAPE and are now in medical school or residencies all over the country.  CAPE has been profiled in a number of articles both in the lay and medical press.  The program is unique as there is no other program that Dr. Friedman is familiar with that allows undergraduate students the close supervised and then unsupervised interaction with patients.</p>
				<p>Dr. Friedman serves on the advisory board of a number of organizations including Voices Against Brain Cancer, the Tug McGraw Foundation, Pinnacle Care, the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation, the National Children’s Cancer Society and the Association for Brain Tumor Research.  He has received a number of awards for his work including the Visionary Award from the Tug McGraw Foundation and the Gary Lichtenstein Humanitarian Award from the Voices Against Brain Cancer Foundation.  He is a member of the American Society of Clinical Investigation.</p>
				<p>Dr. Friedman is married to Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, one of the worlds’ leaders in marrow, peripheral blood and umbilical cord stem cell transplantation.  They are the proud parents of Joshua and Sara.</p>
