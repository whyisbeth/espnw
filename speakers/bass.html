				<h3>WBCA</h3>
				<p>Beth Bass became Chief Executive Officer of the WBCA on Nov. 1, 2001. Only the second individual to assume this position in the 30-year history of the WBCA, Bass is the successor of Betty F. Jaynes who retired in November 2000 from the organization she helped found. Bass assumed the role of CEO of the organization as originally stipulated during her hire by the WBCA Board of Directors in late 1996. She originally joined the WBCA in January 1997 as Executive Director.</p>

				<p>Bass' experience at Converse was not limited to women's athletics. She coordinated several marketing and merchandise programs geared toward the global basketball audience. These efforts encompassed basketball at a variety of levels including recreational basketball with "Hoop it Up," men's college basketball with the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and professional basketball with the NBA's All-Star Weekend.</p>
				<p>A native of Hartsville, South Carolina, Bass was a four-year women's basketball letter winner at East Tennessee State University, where she graduated with honors in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science in her double-major of public relations/advertising and political science. </p>
				<p>Upon leaving ETSU, Bass enrolled at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where she served as a graduate assistant for marketing and promotions in the Lady Volunteers athletic department. She completed her Master's degree in recreation administration at UT in 1986. In 1998, Beth received an Award of Honor from East Tennessee State, which is given each year to Outstanding Alumni recognizing outstanding accomplishment and representation of East Tennessee State. The award only goes out to a maximum of four ETSU alumnae per year. </p>
				<p>Bass received the President's Award from the National Association of Girls and Women in Sport (NAGWS) in April of 2004. She was honored for her efforts in promoting and marketing The State Farm Wade Trophy.</p>
				<p>In 2007, Bass assisted in the launch of one of the most successful grassroots marketing campaigns for breast cancer awareness with the success of the WBCA Pink ZoneÂ®.

The Kay Yow Cancer Fund was launched on December 3, 2007, and serves as the WBCA's first health initiative on record.</p>
