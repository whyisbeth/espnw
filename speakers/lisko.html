				<h3>Executive Communication Director</h3>
				<p>25 years of leadership and innovation</p>
				<p>John Lisko has been at the forefront of marketing and advertising innovation and leadership, for nearly 25-years.  Lisko focused his media communications career exclusively inside creative agencies – not media-centic agencies.  In this environment, he partners with creative directors to make ideas that are big enough, elastic enough and compelling enough to invite customers to participate with their brand ideas.  </p>
				<p>Since 2003, Lisko has been leading media communications at Saatchi & Saatchi. Based in Los Angeles, he is responsible for media communication strategy and execution, event marketing, and all forms of digital media (gaming, social, mobile, etc…). Under Lisko’s leadership, he’s grown the agency’s media team to successfully compete and innovate at the leading edge of the massive shifts in today’s evolving communications landscape, where media really does matter.  </p>
				<p>Lisko believes all ideas begin with deep customer insights and are media-neutral. Ideas need to develop to effectively engage the consumer; whether traditional broadcast and print media, or wide-ranging digital initiatives, live events, promotions or brand activation. And if the opportunity doesn’t exist, we need to create it.</p>
				<p>The Ohio-native earned a B.S. in B.A. at Youngstown State University (Go Penguins!). His advertising career included agency’s in New York City, Cleveland and now Los Angeles – across multiple business industries.</p>
