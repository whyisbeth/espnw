				<h3>Global Vice President of Sports Nutrition for Gatorade</h3>
				<p>She comes to PepsiCo after 10 years at Nike, where she was responsible for driving global business growth for the company’s Women’s category, where she split time between the company’s domestic and European headquarters and drove the strategic direction and worldwide business growth across sales, merchandising, brand marketing and retail presentation. As she advanced at Nike, Fairchild developed a reputation as a creative and innovative marketer with a strong understanding of what makes athletes tick. She led a wide variety of marketing initiatives, including the execution of inspiring retail and out-of-home campaigns, the development of online and off-line training programs for athletes, and coordination of endurance sporting events. Prior to joining Nike, Fairchild spent time leading marketing and retail efforts for specialty retailers. </p>
				<p>In her Gatorade role, Fairchild helps to guide and implement the brand’s overall strategic vision around the world, which began with the spring 2010 launch of the G Series, a new line of products supported by the latest science and developed in collaboration with the world’s greatest athletes to provide fuel, fluid and nutrients before, during and after activity. She also helped Gatorade to identify future innovation opportunities that expanded the brand’s category-leading portfolio of sports performance solutions as well as led Gatorade’s move into sports performance retail channels. She is now focused on driving that same strategic vision as Gatorade expands its footprint in other key International markets; looking to lead the brand and the strategy in being the world leader in fueling athletic performance. </p>
