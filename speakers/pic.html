				<h3>Six-time US Criterium National Champion</h3>
				<p>Six-time US Criterium National Champion Tina Pic will line up with the Colavita/espnW Pro Cycling Team to race the Tour of Elk Grove.  The three-stage event begins Friday, August 3rd and includes a 4.5-mile time trial, criterium, and circuit race.</p>
				<p>Pic, one of the most accomplished cyclists in the pro peloton, stepped back from competition at the end of the 2009 season.  In her 15-year career, Pic won virtually every major criterium in North America as well as the overall US Speedweek Criterium Series title.  She also holds two gold medals in the road race from the Pan American Games and raced with the US team at six World Championships.  Pic served as co-director of Colavita's women's pro team in 2010 and advised the US National Team at key European races this spring. </p>
				<p>Returning to the Colavita pro squad this season as co-director with former teammate Iona Wynter Parks, Pic finished fourth at the Exergy Twilight Criterium, demonstrating that her legendary sprint remains a force to be reckoned with.  Pic will be joined at the Tour of Elk Grove starting line by Colavita/espnW riders Kathryn Bertine, Jamie Dinkins Bookwalter Joanie Caron, Moriah MacGregor, and Mary Zider.</p>
