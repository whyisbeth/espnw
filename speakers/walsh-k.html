				<!--<h3>Bio Coming Soon!</h3>-->
				<p>Nicknamed “Six Feet of Sunshine,” Kerri Walsh and teammate, Misty May-Treanor have been called “the greatest beach volleyball team of all time.” Along with partner Misty, Kerri had one of the longest and most impressive winning streaks in professional sports after winning 89 straight matches on the AVP Tour as well as the international circuit between 2003 and 2004. In 2007 her 20 wins (domestic and international combined) tied her with Misty for the most wins in a single season.</p>
				<p>Kerri captured the public’s imagination in 2004 by bringing home a Gold Medal from the Athens Summer Games, and soon afterwards started a stretch of 50 consecutive match victories. Kerri and Misty have also captured the SWATCH-FIVB World Championships in 2003 (Rio de Janeiro), 2005 (Berlin) and 2007 (Gstaad).</p>
				<p>In 2006, Kerri became the fourth American woman to surpass $1 million in career earnings, accomplishing the feat in Chicago. She and Misty established AVP team records for wins (13) and prize money ($408,800), while Kerri set the standard for season wins by an individual (14) and prize money ($242,650).</p>
				<p>In 2008, Kerri and Misty captured Gold again at the Beijing Summer Games.</p>
				<p>Kerri has led the AVP in both blocks and hitting percentage in 2005, 2006 and 2007. She has been the top-ranked player each season she has played domestically.</p>
				<p>Kerri came to the beach with impeccable indoor credentials. She graduated from Stanford University with a BA in American Studies. While there, she became only the second player in NCAA history to receive First-Team All-American honors all four seasons (1996-1999). She was also the first player in PAC-10 history to record 1,500 kills (1,553), 1,200 digs (1,285) and 500 blocks (502). Kerri is considered to be one of the best all-around players in collegiate history.</p>
				<p>Before her successful transition to the beach, Kerri had a thriving indoor career where she was a member of the United States National Team for two seasons (1999-2000) and was a right side hitter on the 2000 Olympic Team, helping the team play in the medal round and finish fourth in Sydney.</p>
				<p>Kerri has appeared in several television commercials, and has been a guest on a number of popular talk shows. In 2006, she had guest-starring role in an episode of CSI: Miami.</p>
				<p>Currently, Kerri lives in Hermosa Beach, California with her husband, Casey Jennings, one of the top men’s volleyball players on the Tour, and two sons.</p>
