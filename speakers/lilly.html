				<h3>Retired American Soccer Player</h3>
				<p><p>To say Kristine Lilly’s story unfolds like a highlight reel would be a vast understatement, it unfolds more like a sports legend’s Hollywood bio-pic – a film that would be aptly titled “Always Believe.” </p>
				<p>When she retired from soccer in January, 2011, at the age of 38, Kristine had played at the game’s highest level in four different decades; she played in five World Cups and 3 Olympic Games; she is a two-time World Champion and a two-time Gold Medalist, she’s a 23 year veteran of the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team, and she’s played in 352 games for her county – more than any other person in the world.  As I read this, she is the 2nd leading scorer in the world behind Mia Hamm.  </p>
				<p>Kristine is a natural leader.  She was captain of the U.S. National Team from 2005-2007 and captain of the Boston Breakers of Women’s Professional Soccer from 2001-2003, and again from 2009 to 2010.  She was a five-time all-star for the Breakers and just this past year, the team retired her #13 jersey.  Also in the past year, President Barack Obama designated Kristine as a member of his presidential delegation to the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup.</p>
				<p>Her list of achievements is long, awe-inspiring and nearly overwhelming in its comprehensive greatness but believe me, she is modest and very appreciative of her success.  She rarely talks about herself; in fact, she is more comfortable talking about being a mom to her beautiful daughters Sidney and Jordan, so it’s up to me to talk about Kristine, the soccer player.   </p>
				<p>Many in our audience know Kristine from the 1999 U.S. Women’s World Cup Team.  You may remember her game-saving header that sent a thrilling championship match into overtime – a match the U.S. won on penalty kicks.  It’s a good moment to remember, and it’s one of many from that 1999 team that helped revolutionize women’s sports in America.  What many in our audience may not know is that before taking the World Cup stage, Kristine was a big-time talent in small-town New England.</p>
				<p>As a teenager in Wilton, CT, Kristine helped the Wilton High School girls’ soccer team win three state championships.  And it was in Wilton where her abilities garnered national attention.  In 1987, the U.S. Women’s National Team came calling and soon later, at the age of 16, she played her first game for her country.  </p>
				<p>Next Kristine played collegiately for the University of North Carolina, where she earned a degree in Communications, four ACC Championships, four NCAA Championships, two captainships, and four first-team All-America honors.  Oh, and she had her jersey retired there too. </p>
				<p>After college Kristine went on to more U.S. National Team glory, and added the words “world-class soccer instructor” and “humanitarian” to her peerless résumé.  </p>
				<p>She has helped to raise thousands of dollars for Special Olympics Connecticut, worked to help clothe the homeless with Clifford’s Gift of Boston, and in April 2012 she will run the Boston Marathon on behalf of Children’s Hospital Boston.  Visiting youngsters at Children’s Hospital is something Kristine does regularly; helping them stay positive is something she does nationally. </p>
				<p>In the last 15 years, along with running private soccer clinics and making public appearances, Kristine and her Kristine Lilly Soccer Academy have given thousands of young athletes the opportunity to train, have fun, and learn valuable life lessons.  More recently, Kristine and her former teammates and friend Mia Hamm and Tisha Venturini Hoch founded the TEAM FIRST Soccer Academy - a traveling soccer academy that will allow her to teach the game young athletes across the country, while letting them know that it’s quite all right to “Always Believe.”</p>
