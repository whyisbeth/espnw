				<!--<h3>Bio Coming Soon!</h3>-->
				<p>I am coming to the Summit as a representative of the Oakley women's brand! I am looking forward to learning more about women in sports from the amazing group of speakers that you have pulled together in Tuscon! I have spent almost 10 years at Oakley and for 3 of those I lived in Milan and Zurich and worked out of our European office. I currently work on brand strategy for Oakley and I love being back in California. When I am not working, I spend my time cycling, surfing and being at the beach, playing softball, running, and doing lots and lots of yoga! I have an intense passion for cooking], wine and traveling. I was raised in Texas, but born in Denver so I am a Denver Broncos fan and thus my song selection below. As a 2003 University of Texas alum, I always root for Longhorn Texas football in my heart!</p>
