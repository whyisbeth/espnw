Jill joined ESPN as a coordinating producer in ESPN’s remote production in December 2003 and was promoted to senior coordinating producer in April 2008.  Prior to becoming staff at ESPN, Jill was a freelance producer, working predominately for ESPN, producing auto racing, X Games, Great Outdoor Games and College Basketball.  She has won multiple Sports Emmy awards, including for her work on NBC's coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympics as well as the Opening Tease for the 2006 Indianapolis 500 on ABC.  Jill is a Class XXIV graduate of the Betsy Magness Leadership Institute.</p>
