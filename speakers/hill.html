				<h3>Columnist and Television Personality for ESPN</h3>
				<p>Hill arrived at ESPN in November 2006, and since then has established herself as one of the network’s most provocative, popular and versatile personalities. In addition to writing a weekly column for ESPN.com, she makes regular television appearances on ESPN’s “First Take,” “The Sports Reporters,” and “Around The Horn.” In the fall of 2012, Hill joined the network’s Friday night college football coverage as a sideline reporter.  </p>
				<p>Hill began her professional career in Raleigh, North Carolina as a general assignment sports reporter for the News & Observer, where her reporting focused primarily on women’s sports issues. In 1998, Hill won the North Carolina State Press Association Award for best feature writing for her story on Mandy Garcia, the Citadel’s first female athlete. </p>
				<p>In the fall of 1998, Hill returned to her hometown newspaper, the Detroit Free Press, to cover Michigan State men’s basketball and football. She covered the Spartans for six years, but during that time she also was assigned to cover a variety of major sports events. She covered six Final Fours (including the Women’s Final Four in 2003), four Bowl Championship Series national championships, the 2004 Summer Olympics, and the NBA playoffs in 2003 and 2004. </p>
				<p>Those invaluable experiences prepared her for her next move to the Orlando Sentinel, where she became the only black female sports columnist among 305 daily newspapers, according to the Associated Press Sports Editors (APSE) 2006 Racial and Gender Report Card. As a general assignment sports columnist, Hill regularly offered stimulating columns on Florida, Florida State, the Orlando Magic, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Miami Dolphins. She also was a member of the Tribune Company’s reporting team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.</p>
				<p>She left the Sentinel in the fall of 2006 to become a columnist for ESPN.com, which triggered her role as a television analyst across ESPN’s family of networks.</p>
				<p>Since joining ESPN, Hill has produced a number of thought-provoking columns, especially on race and gender. Her column on former Colorado kicker Katie Knida was given an honorable mention in the 2007 edition of Best American Sports Writing. Her piece on the dearth of white running backs, and criticism of LeBron James’ cover photograph for Vogue magazine generated widespread discussion in the national media.</p>
				<p>Hill’s rise in journalism has been acknowledged by her peers. She was the first recipient of the Poynter Sports Summit’s McKenize Cup, which is bestowed upon exemplary, young sports journalists. And in May 2007, Michigan State University’s College of Communication Arts & Sciences gave her The Rising Star Award, an honor bestowed upon recent graduates for commendable work in their field.</p>
