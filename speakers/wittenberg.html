				<h3>NYRR President and CEO <br/>
					Race Director of the ING New York City Marathon</h3>
				<p>As president and CEO of NYRR and race director of the ING New York City Marathon, Mary Wittenberg is responsible for setting strategy and overseeing the business and operations of NYRR. Pursuing a consistent growth strategy, Wittenberg and her team have elevated NYRR’s prominence and impact as they seek to lead a global running movement by making running more accessible to a broader audience.</p>
				<p>Wittenberg, the first woman to lead NYRR, and her team have expanded the organization’s commitment to the five boroughs of New York City through youth running events and community health programs—creating an unrivaled urban running model. Under her leadership, NYRR has broadened its horizons, fueled by a year-round calendar of classes, clinics, and events. Off the race course, the organization's media reach includes digital, broadcast, and print vehicles. The ING New York City Marathon and its impact have grown dramatically—in 2011, the largest marathon ever boasted more than 47,000 finishers, $340 million in revenue for our city, and over $34 million raised for charities. They've also created new events like the NYC Half.</p>
				<p>Partnerships are crucial to furthering NYRR's mission, and have grown substantially. This year, Wittenberg and her team secured a five-year deal to return the New York City Marathon to live national television for the first time in almost 20 years. And to build the sport's fan base and inspire the next generation of runners, NYRR has offered unprecedented support to world-class competitors. Leaders of the pack in New York and across the United States have gained strength through NYRR’s post-collegiate running groups, and athletes from around the world come together in the World Marathon Majors—a two-year, five-race series created in 2006 in partnership with the directors of the Boston, London, Berlin, and Chicago Marathons. Wittenberg and her team have also hosted several national championships, including the 2006 USA Cross Country Championships and the 2008 US Men’s Olympic Trials Marathon.</p>
				<p>Wittenberg joined NYRR in late 1998 and became its first Chief Operating Officer in 2000. In 2005 she became President and CEO as well as Race Director of the New York City Marathon. Prior to joining NYRR, she was a partner in the law firm Hunton & Williams in Richmond, VA, and New York City. Wittenberg is a graduate of Canisius College in Buffalo and holds a law degree from Notre Dame University. She won the 1987 Marine Corps Marathon and competed in the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon. She and her husband live a short run from Central Park with their two basketball-playing sons.</p>
