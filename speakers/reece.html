				<p>Women’s Sports & Fitness named Gabby one of the ‘20 Most Influential Women in Sports’ (August 1997). Regarding their choice of Gabby for the issue’s cover, the magazine’s editor wrote, “Because I believe she represents, finally, the answer to all the image-questing pendulum swinging of the decades gone by. Who is the female athlete? She is everything once thought to be an inherent contradiction. She is strong and beautiful, sweaty and feminine, tough and ladylike.”</p>
