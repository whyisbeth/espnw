				<!--<h3>Bio Coming Soon!</h3>-->
				<p>Christy King currently serves as the in-house technology consultant and tech vendor manager for Zuffa, LLC sports entertainment brands, including the UFC® (Ultimate Fighting Championship®). The UFC and mixed-martial arts have experienced massive growth in a very short amount of time, culminating in the recent partnership with FOX network, a major worldwide sports television brand. Christy actively researches, tests and implements new and emerging methods to share content information among media partners in traditional television, gaming consoles, mobile technologies, OTT boxes, internet platforms and other emerging technologies for content distribution, worldwide. </p>
				<p>Zuffa, LLC recruited Christy in early 2006 from a CBS affiliate in the Deep South. She has a background in video production, including writing, producing, and editing on AVID platforms. Christy developed early expertise in “the web” in 1994 when she built a commercial website, one of only 500 commercial websites then existing. Even during the early days of the web, she understood and envisioned incredible opportunities emerging for niche content film and video producers who would be able to easily and cheaply distribute content.</p>
				<p>Christy is currently collaborating with several vendors to create a Digital Asset Management system for video production and distribution, as well as orchestrating the design and development of business asset management that automates many other day-to-day business communications. Christy also has begun work on a technology start-up that will simplify the sharing of videos shot on mobile devices to make it easy for companies to access and use mobile video in their social media (and other) production efforts. Finally, Christy is a huge sports fan, and is an avid participator in adult amateur competitions such as USTA leagues, cross fit and rock climbing.</p>
