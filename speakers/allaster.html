				<h3>Chairman and CEO of the Women's Tennis Association</h3>
				<p>A consummate tennis professional named by Forbes magazine as one of the "Most Powerful Women in Sports," Stacey Allaster is the Chairman and CEO of the Women's Tennis Association, the governing body of women's tennis. Women's tennis is the largest global sport for women, represented by 1,000 players who compete for a record $96 million in prize money at 52 tournaments and 4 Grand Slams in 33 countries.</p>
				<p>Allaster's tenure as Chairman and CEO began in July 2009 and has been marked by her focus on maximizing the fan experience through a series of on-court and digital innovations; securing a record number of new sponsors; ensuring the financial success of the sport; and enhancing the health and well-being of the athletes.</p>
				<p>An advocate for women, Allaster was instrumental in securing equal prize money for women tennis players at all four Grand Slams, which was finally completed in 2007 when Wimbledon and Roland Garros committed to offering equal pay to male and female athletes.</p>
				<p>Allaster holds a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Physical Education from the University of Western Ontario, and an MBA from the Ivey School of Business. The mother to children Jack and Alexandra, Allaster and husband John Milkovich reside in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p>
