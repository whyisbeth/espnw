				<!--<h3>Bio Coming Soon!</h3>-->
				<p>I always wanted to be a Cyclone like my parents, and after I graduated high school in 2000, I attended Iowa State on a track scholarship. Life took a turn and I transferred to Southern Methodist University during my sophomore year, where I earned my BA in Cinema-Television and was a varsity rower. After graduating, I began my career at NBA Entertainment. After a few short months I was lured back to the DFW Metroplex, accepting a position with FSN Southwest writing, producing and editing on-air promos. Arriving at ESPN in 2007 as an Associate Producer in Cross Platform Newsgathering, I worked on pretty much every studio show to come out of Bristol. After two years I became a Preditor for the morning SportsCenters and X Center. I've been an athlete longer than I can remember, and after earning my MS in Entertainment Business from Full Sail University in 2010, moving over to espnW was all the more exciting for the opportunities and challenges it presents as an emerging business.</p>
