				<!--<h3>Headline</h3>-->
				<p>For over two decades, Tonya Antonucci has expressed her passion for women’s soccer as a player, coach, executive and fan. </p>
				<p>Over a four year planning and fundraising period as head of Women’s Soccer Initiative (WSII), she led the effort to create the U.S.-based Women’s Professional Soccer (WPS) and served as its first Commissioner from September 2007 through September 2010. Antonucci successfully engineered the launch by developing the business model, identifying fan demographics, establishing operating standards, raising capital and negotiating sponsorship and television agreements with MLS’ Soccer United Marketing (SUM), Fox Soccer Channel and Comcast RSNs.</p>
				<p>Prior to joining WPS, Antonucci spent more than seven years with Yahoo, Inc. where she launched Yahoo! Sports and Yahoo! Fantasy Sports, and served as Director of those properties.  Subsequently, she was named General Manager of Yahoo’s partnership with FIFA and oversaw the commercialization of the official, global web sites for the 2002 FIFA Men’s and 2003 Women’s World Cups.</p>
				<p>In addition, Antonucci has worked as a product manager at Starwave, a software company funded by Microsoft’s Paul Allen, and as the assistant women’s soccer coach at Stanford University and Santa Clara University while working on an M.B.A. degree.</p>
				<p>A native of Everett, Wash. and a H.S. All-American and 1984 U.S. Jr. National Team member, Antonucci is a political science and economics graduate of Stanford University, where she played collegiate soccer, was named to the All-Far West team, and co-captained the Stanford team her senior year.</p>
				<p>Antonucci currently resides in the Bay Area, where she consults for sports and technology companies and serves on the board of iSoccer.</p>
