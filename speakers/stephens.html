				<!--<h3>Bio Coming Soon!</h3>-->
				<p>Sloane Stephens picked up a racket for the first time at age 9. Her family then moved to Florida where she began her pursuit of her goal to become a professional tennis player. Sloane honed her technical skills at Saviano High Performance Tennis Academy in Ft. Lauderdale. Sloane comes from an extremely athletic family as her mom Sybil, in 1988 as a swimmer at Boston University, became the first African-American female to be named First Team All-American in Division I history and her dad, John Stephens, played in the NFL.</p>
				<p>Sloane Stephens, 19, turned professional in October 2009.  In 2010, Sloane won three of the four Junior Grand Slam Doubles titles: the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US  Open. She reached the singles quarterfinals at the French Open, Wimbledon, and the semi-finals at the US Open.</p>
				<p>Due to WTA age eligibility rules, 2011 was a big year for Sloane. For the first time Sloane was eligible to play a full WTA tournament schedule. She enjoyed a breakthrough on the WTA tour in 2011 becoming the youngest player ranked in the WTA top 100 (#89). </p>
				<p>Sloane had her best year yet in 2012, as she became the youngest player ranked inside the WTA top 50 (#38).  She was the youngest player remaining in all four Grand Slams this year and the last American remaining in the 2012 French Open for both Males and Females, outlasting the likes of Serena Williams, Venus Williams, John Isner, and Andy Roddick.</p>
				<p>Sloaneâ€™s inspirations in tennis are Venus Williams, Serena Williams and Kim Clijsters. Her goal in tennis is to become the best person and player that she can be. Off court, Sloane has been featured in Teen Vogue, ESPN The Magazine, USA Today, Vogue, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated.  She also enjoys posting inspirational tweets to her friends and followers.</p>
