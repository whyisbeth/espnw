				<h3>Former President, WNBA<br/>
				U.S. Representative, International Basketball Federation</h3>
				<p>Val Ackerman was the founding President of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the first woman to serve as President of USA Basketball, which oversees the U.S. men's and women's Olympic basketball program. She is currently a sports consultant and an adjunct professor in the graduate sports management program at Columbia University.  She also serves as the U.S. representative to the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), the sport's world governing body.</p>
				<p>Val grew up in New Jersey and attended the University of Virginia, where she was among the school's first female student-athlete scholarship recipients. She was a four-year starter, three-time captain and two-time Academic All-American for the Cavaliers and earned a degree in political and social thought in 1981. She played one year of professional basketball in France and went on to earn a law degree from UCLA in 1985. She worked as an associate at the New York law firm of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett before joining the National Basketball Association as a staff attorney in 1988.</p>
				<p>Val was as an executive at the NBA for eight years, serving as Special Assistant to NBA Commissioner David Stern and Director (and later) Vice President of Business Affairs before being named the WNBA's first President in 1996. She guided the league to a much-heralded launch in 1997 and oversaw its day-to-day operations for its first eight seasons. The league, which played its 16th season in 2012, is the longest-running women's professional team sports league in the U.S. and one of the premier women's sports organizations in the world.</p>
				<p>In 2005, Val was elected President of USA Basketball for the 2005-08 term, leading the organization to an overall competitive record of 222-23 and gold medal performances by the U.S. men's and women's basketball teams at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. A USA Basketball Board member since 1989, Val has played a key role in the long-standing success of the U.S. women's national basketball team program, which won gold medals at the 1998, 2002 and 2010 FIBA World Championships and 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games.</p>
				<p>Val's efforts in the sports business have earned her many awards, including the Brandweek Co-Marketer of the Year, the U. Va. Distinguished Alumna Award, induction into the GTE Academic All-America Hall of Fame and International Scholar-Athlete Hall of Fame, the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award, the Girls Scouts of America National Women of Distinction Award, the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund Equal Opportunity Award, the International Olympic Committee Women and Sport Achievement Diploma, the Sports Business Journal Champions Award, and the John Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, where she serves as a member of the Board of Trustees.</p>
				<p>Val continues to serve ex officio on the USA Basketball Board of Directors and is a member of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. She is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, where she was inducted in June 2011 as a contributor, and the Board of Directors of the Virginia Athletics Foundation.</p>
				<p>She is a contributing columnist to espnw.com.</p>
				<p>Val and her husband, Charlie Rappaport, live in New York City and have two daughters, Emily and Sally.</p>
