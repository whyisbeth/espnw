				<h3>Premier Partnerships</h3>
				<p>Stephanie Cheng joined Premier Partnerships in 2007 as an Associate Consultant.  With an international background in sports operations, analytics, and market research, Cheng brought with her strategic business perspective, as well as practical operational experience to Premier.  Upon her arrival at Premier, she focused on development and marketing of Premier’s Revenue Maximizer™.  The Revenue Maximizer™ allows Premier clients to strategically develop their sponsorship platform, and helps them understand their own “real market” sponsorship value.  Cheng has since led Revenue Maximizer™ projects for clients, including for many of the country’s latest stadium and arena naming rights agreements.  Clients have included NFL International, O.co Coliseum, Mammoth Mountain, the Breeders’ Cup, SDSU, the NHL’s Nashville Predators, Super Bowl XLV Host Committee, PNC Bank Arts Center, and a variety of municipalities and youth facilities.  </p>
				<p>On the heels of the success of the Revenue Maximizer™ and her leadership within the company, Cheng now serves as Premier’s Vice President, Marketing Services.  In her new position, Cheng is responsible for the Marketing Services team, and internal and external marketing efforts for Premier and its clients.  The Marketing Services team works with Premier’s expert sales team to create strategic collateral, customized proposals, and detailed deliverables for prospective sponsors and clients. Cheng also continues to oversee the Revenue Maximizer™ business and service Premier’s consulting clients on next generation solutions to complex challenges facing the industry.  </p>
				<p>Prior to joining Premier, Cheng worked with Lieberman Research Worldwide where she managed both quantitative and qualitative research projects.  During her time there, she focused on providing the highest quality research, as well as actionable client recommendations.  Cheng was also part of the Athletes’ Village team for the Doha Asian Games 2006, where she managed live entertainment for more than 10,000 athletes and team officials.</p>
				<p>Cheng is a graduate of the University of Southern California with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with emphases in Global Business and International Relations.  While at USC, she also spent time working with the Los Angeles Avengers, US Olympic Committee, ESPN X Games, and AEG/Chivas USA.
