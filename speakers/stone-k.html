The Clinic treats athletes and people with arthritis focused on knee and shoulder injuries.  The Foundation conducts research in advanced surgical techniques and tissue regeneration for orthopaedic sports medicine.  These efforts have led to improvements in cartilage replacement and regeneration, cruciate ligament repair and reconstruction, and techniques to prevent osteoarthritic degeneration.   Dr. Stone has lectured around the world as an expert in cartilage and meniscal growth, replacement, and repair.  He holds more than 50 U.S. patents on novel inventions to improve health care.</p>

He is the Founder of Aperion Biologics, Inc., (formerly CrossCart, Inc.) a venture capital funded medical device xenotransplantation company. Aperion has developed a technique for removing the antigens from pig tissues so that they may be used in humans. The first xenograft device for reconstruction of ruptured cruciate ligaments (ACLs) has received FDA approval for human clinical trials. Dr. Stone is the Founder and Chairman of Joint Juice, Inc., a San Francisco-based nutraceutical beverage company. Joint Juice is the first beverage with a full day’s dose of glucosamine, proven to reduce pain, act as an anti-inflammatory, and aid in cartilage repair without side effects. Joint Juice gained wide national distribution at Costco, Sam’s Clubs, Walgreens and Wal-Mart after its first year of launch and is now the widest distributed supplement in America.  Dr. Stone also founded Rescue Reel, Inc., which received the Popular Science Ten Best Inventions of the Year 2009 award.
