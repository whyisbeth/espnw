				<h3>Vice President, Production</h3>
				<p>Stephanie Druley was named vice president, production, for the 24/7 University of Texas channel Longhorn Network in March 2011.  She has returned to her home state of Texas to oversee the overall production of Longhorn Network. Her responsibilities include studio and remote productions, the look of all on-air content and the hiring of all network talent. </p>
				<p>Prior to joining Longhorn Network, Druley was a senior coordinating producer in the studio production department overseeing all NFL studio shows for ESPN — including the Emmy Award-winning Sunday NFL Countdown, Monday Night Countdown, NFL PrimeTime and NFL Live.  In addition to managing all content, planning, budgeting and staffing for those programs, Druley was responsible for ESPN’s annual on-site coverage of the Super Bowl.</p>
				<p>Previously, Druley served as coordinating producer of Sunday NFL Countdown, a program she worked on for more than a decade.  She led the popular two-hour weekly NFL preview show to three Emmy Awards in the Outstanding Weekly Studio Show category (2001, 2003 and 2007), and, in 2008, both Sunday NFL Countdown and Monday Night Countdown were nominated for a Sports Emmy for the first time. </p>
				<p>In 2006, Druley developed the annual  SportsCenter “My Wish” summer series, a collaborative effort with the Make-A-Wish Foundation that chronicles the granting of unique sports-related wishes for children (ages 6-15) with life-threatening medical conditions. </p>
				<p>Druley began her ESPN career in 1990 as a production assistant and advanced through the ESPN ranks from as an associate producer (1996-99) highlights supervisor (1999-2000), producer (2000-02) and coordinating producer (2002-05) to being named senior coordinating producer in the fall of 2005.  </p>
				<p>A Houston native, Druley earned a bachelor of journalism degree from the University of Texas at Austin.  A member of Women in Cable & Telecommunications (WICT), Druley is a Betsy Magness Leadership Institute Fellow, a distinguished year-long educational program designed to elevate women leaders in the cable and telecommunications industry.</p>
