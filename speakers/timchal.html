				<p>Legendary head coach Cindy Timchal will enter her sixth season at the helm of the women's lacrosse program at the United States Naval Academy in 2013. Timchal, who is entering her 31st year as a head coach, is the NCAA's all-time leader in career wins (412) for any division, in men's or women's college lacrosse. Additionally, her eight national titles are the eighth most by a coach in a women's sport in NCAA?history, and the 26th most in all sports, men and women combined.</p>
				<p>Timchal was named the Midshipmen's first women's lacrosse coach on August 5, 2006, and in short order, has laid the foundation for a Navy program that is moving quickly in its quest to become a NCAA?Division I?power.</p>
				<p>In her five seasons at the helm of the Midshipmen program, Navy has accumulated a terrific 76-22 (.776) record, won three Patriot League Championships and has advanced to three straight NCAA Tournaments (2010-2012).</p>
				<p>The 2012 team advanced to a third straight NCAA Tournament after winning its third Patriot League title game. The Mids posted a 6-0 record during conference play to earn their first outright Patriot League Regular Season title and hosting duties for the postseason tournament. Navy breezed through the four-team tournament, outscoring its opponents by a score of 32-18.</p>
				<p>The Mids received a challenging draw following the league title with a NCAA Play-In Game at MPSF-Champion Oregon. Navy rallied from a late 9-7 deficit to defeat the Ducks in overtime, 10-9, to advance to the NCAA First Round where the team would fall to No. 5 North Carolina, 14-7.</p>
				<p>Navy finished the season ranked in the deBeer Media Poll for the third straight season in 2012, coming in at No. 19 in the year-end poll. Jasmine DePompeo became Navy's first Academic All-American in 2012, earning third-team honors while also appearing on the IWLCA All-South Region squad for the second straight year.</p>
				<p>The Mids posted an 18-3 overall record in 2012, setting a school and Patriot League record for most wins in a season. Timchal was named the Patriot League Coach of the Year for the first time in 2012.</p>
				<p>During the 2012 season, Timchal became the first college lacrosse coach, at any level and either gender, to win 400 career games and also received word that she would be a member of the 2012 induction class to the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.</p>
				<p>The 2011 Navy squad proved that the program was poised to remain on the national scene. Upping its strength of schedule for the fourth-straight season, the Mids gained valuable experience by taking on top teams, including a home game against eventual national champion Northwestern.</p>
				<p>The Mids entered the 2011 Patriot League Tournament as the No. 3 seed, but won two straight games, including rallying from a five-goal deficit to defeat top-seeded Colgate in the championship game.</p>
				<p>After the Mids disposed of Quinnipiac in the NCAA Play-In Game, the 2011 season ended at top-ranked Maryland in the NCAA First Round. The Mids posted a 15-6 record in 2011.</p>
				<p>Sophomore Jasmine DePompeo became the 54th All-American under Timchal after ranking third in the nation with 99 points scored.</p>
				<p>It was a year of firsts in 2010, as Navy set a school and conference record with 17 victories, captured its first league tournament title and concluded the season ranked 19th nationally.</p>
				<p>Along the way, the Mids broke their own Patriot League scoring record with 305 goals and produced both the program's first All-American, nation's leading scorer and conference player of the year in Erin Rawlick ('10).</p>
				<p>It had been over a decade (13 years to be exact) since a new program has qualified for the NCAA Tournament faster than the three years it has taken Navy. In fact, only two programs have ever earned national tournament bids faster, with one of those squads being Timchal's fledgling Northwestern team in 1983. Timchal became the first coach in collegiate women's lacrosse history to lead three different programs to the NCAA Tournament</p>
				<p>Year two saw Navy put together another 13-win season in 2009. The Mids produced four league all-stars and advanced to the program's first-ever Patriot League Championship Game.</p>
				<p>During its inaugural Division I campaign in 2008, all Timchal did was lead Navy on a historic run which saw the Mids set an NCAA record for wins by a first-year program with 13 and earn their first Patriot League Tournament appearance.</p>
				<p>When all was said and done, Timchal and an underclassmen-laden Navy squad, wrapped up the season at 13-4, including an 11-0 mark on its home turf, and as the owners of the second-ranked scoring offense in the nation. Her on-the-field impact was undeniable, as Navy produced the second-highest clip in NCAA history (16.65 goals per game).</p>
				<p>In 2007, Timchal provided a glimpse into the bright future for that lie ahead for Midshipmen women's lacrosse by leading the Academy's club squad to an 18-5 mark, including its first win over a Division I opponent and a runner-up finish at the USL/WDIA National Tournament.</p>
				<p>Timchal's coaching career got its start at Northwestern in 1982. During her nine-year tenure with the Wildcats, she compiled a 76-40 record (.655) while leading the program to five NCAA appearances. While at Northwestern, Timchal made it as far as the quarterfinals, earning appearances in the NCAA Tournament in 1983, '84, '86, '87, and '88. In 1991, she made the move to College Park to revive and renew the strong tradition of Terrapin lacrosse.</p>
				<p>Prior to her arrival at the storied program, its last title had come in 1986, but almost immediately the Terrapins restored their reign atop the sport. Timchal's first year saw a 14-3 mark and a trip to the NCAA finals. By 1992, the lacrosse world sensed something special was on the horizon at Maryland. Despite being at a place with a rich history in lacrosse, few could have predicted that a dynasty so powerful was on the horizon. With a 14-1 record, the Terrapins took the 1992 national title -- just the third in school history.</p>
				<p>The 1993 season would bring a heartbreaking 7-6 loss to the Princeton Tigers in the NCAA semifinals. The following year led to further frustration with the Tigers, as a 10-7 decision left the Timchal's squad just one win away from hoisting the trophy yet again. In 1995, however, Timchal and the Terps would turn the tables on the competition.</p>
				<p>After the three-goal loss to Princeton in 1994 finals, the Terps would go on to win 50 straight games. Timchal led the 1995 squad to a 17-0 run ending in a 13-5 defeat of Princeton for the NCAA title. Maryland would go undefeated again in 1996, finishing with a 19-0 record and a 10-5 decision over ACC rival Virginia to take home the hardware.</p>
				<p>Wearing the label of back-to-back NCAA champions, Timchal's squad maintained its dominance, posting a 21-1 record and falling just one goal short of putting together its third consecutive undefeated season. The dynasty continued through the '98 season despite a pair of road ACC losses to begin the year. That season would end the same way as the previous three, however, with Timchal's Terrapins being crowned the NCAA champions once again, this time behind an 11-5 win over Virginia.</p>
				<p>In 1999, from top-to-bottom, Timchal's crew personified excellence, as they produced yet another undefeated season at 21-0 and the program's fifth-straight national title. The 2000 season saw the Terps stumble out of the gate with an overtime loss at North Carolina, but the "machine" could not be stopped as Maryland went on to win its final 20 en route to their sixth title in a row. Following the 2000 season, Timchal was named the National Coach of the Year by both the IWLCA and E-Lacrosse. She was also tabbed as the IWLCA South Region Coach of the Year.</p>
				<p>The 2001 season once again saw Maryland run through its schedule without a blemish as the Terps outlasted Georgetown in a gut-wrenching double-overtime thriller in the title game to finish 23-0. The 23 wins still stand as the most ever by a team in a single season.</p>
				<p>Individually, her athletes have earned countless accolades and awards. Maryland had 21 first team All-Americans in her last nine years, and 13 players took home national offensive, defensive or goalkeeper of the year awards. Jen Adams became the first-ever winner of the Tewaaraton Trophy, which recognizes the top collegiate men's and women's player in the country, and Kelly Coppedge was a finalist in 2004 and 2005. In 1996, Kelly Amonte became the Terps' first four-time All-American, ¬including first-team honors in 1995 and 1996.</p>
				<p>From Kelly Amonte Hiller to Cathy Reese, Alex Kahoe to Alexis Venechanos, Jen Adams to Kelly Coppedge, the one constant amongst all of the great Maryland players has been Cindy Timchal. In just five years of her 16 seasons at College Park did Timchal lose more than three games in any one season, highlighted by spectacular undefeated runs in 1996 (19-0), 1999 (21-0) and 2001 (23-0). She took Terrapin teams to the NCAA finals in 11 seasons, including an unprecedented stretch of seven straight national championships - currently the third-longest championship streak in women's NCAA history. In addition, the run puts Timchal in the company of coaching legends like UCLA's John Wooden who won seven straight titles with the UCLA men's basketball program from 1967-73.</p>
				<p>A total of 53 different student-athletes have earned All-America recognition a total of 95 times under Timchal including Kelly Amonte Hiller's four, (1993-96), and three each for Betsy Elder (1992-94), Sarah Forbes (1995-97), Laura Harmon (1993-95), Sascha Newmarch (1996-98), Jen Adams (1999-2001) and Kelly Coppedge (2002-04). In 2005, Acacia Walker earned first team honors, Greta Sommers was named to the second team and Annie Collines was named third team All-America. Adams' third-consecutive selection as Player of the Year in 2000 marked the 10th time one of Timchal's players have earned National Player of the Year honors, including Amonte Hiller, who was named the 1996 NCAA Division I Most Valuable Player. When the ACC's 50th anniversary Women's Lacrosse Team was announced in 2002, Timchal was selected as the head coach of the squad and had coached 22 members of the team.</p>
				<p>Nationally, 18 of Timchal's players have played on the U.S. Developmental team and five were members of the most recent championship U.S. World Cup team. Seven former Terrapins helped lead Australia to the 2005 World Cup title in Annapolis, including tournament MVP Sarah Forbes. All totaled, 13 Terps represented three countries at the World Cup.</p>
				<p>Beyond the numbers, though, Timchal has done her part to revolutionize the sport of women's lacrosse. In recent years while at Maryland, Timchal brought some of the most influential names in the sport through College Park, including former assistant and lacrosse legend Gary Gait, and more recently former Terrapin stars Cathy Nelson and Jen Adams.</p>
				<p>In addition, former Maryland players have become a fixture on national teams and within the collegiate coaching ranks, demonstrating the breadth of Timchal's influence. In 1996, she introduced a new wrinkle to her vast coaching repertoire as she brought aboard the wisdom of California-based spiritual advisor and renowned author Dr. Jerry Lynch to enrich the minds of her student-athletes. That decision complemented the already high level of physical conditioning it takes to excel at the Division I level and has since become a widespread trend used throughout the world of sports.</p>
				<p>Since her first days in coaching at Northwestern, Timchal's focus has always been on the experience. And as impressive as her on-field success has been, her greatest accomplishments have come off of it. Throughout her career, her athletes have set the bar within the classroom as seven athletes have garnered a total of nine Academic All-America accolades. In 2010, Mary Ruttum ('10) became the first member of Navy's program to be named the Patriot League Women's Lacrosse Scholar-Athlete of the Year.</p>
				<p>Her dedication to her players has inspired a remarkable number of them to follow her into the coaching ranks. This spring, 20 of her former Maryland players will patrol the sidelines on coaching staffs across the country, including Kelly Amonte Hiller (Northwestern head coach), Jen Adams (Loyola head coach), Kerstin Kimel (Duke head coach), Cathy Reese (Maryland head coach) and Karen McCrate (head coach of 2001 NCAA D-II Champion C.W. Post). Timchal's coaching tree also extends outside the sport and into field hockey, where former player Jennifer Averill has won three national titles at Wake Forest. She also served as a mentor to current Dartmouth head coach Amy Patton at Unionville High School.</p>
				<p>Timchal, a graduate of Haverford High, lettered in lacrosse, tennis and track & field at West Chester (Pa.) University before beginning a now legendary career coaching lacrosse at Unionville High School, where she coached field hockey, lacrosse and basketball. In 1979, she joined the collegiate ranks, becoming an assistant lacrosse and field hockey coach at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
				<p>Timchal has been honored with induction into a Hall of Fame by seven different entities. In 2000, Timchal was inducted into the Haverford High School Hall of Fame. In 2004, she was inducted into the West Chester (Pa.) University's Hall of Fame. In 2009, Timchal was inducted into the Delaware County Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame. Timchal is also a member of two US Lacrosse Hall of Fame Chapters: The Philadelphia/Eastern Pennsylvania Chapter (2002) and the Potomac Chapter (2006).</p>
				<p>In October of 2012, Timchal will be inducted to both the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame and the University of Maryland Hall of Fame.</p>
