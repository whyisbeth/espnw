				<h3>Olympic Gymnast</h3>
				<p>My name is Aly Raisman and I am a gymnast! I am a three time olympic medalist. Two time olympic champion, and bronze medalist from the 2012 olympic games. I enjoy hanging out with friends and family. I love fashion and performing!</p>
				<p>---</p>
				<p>Career Highlights: 2012 Olympic team champion, 2012 Olympic floor champion, 2012 Olympic beam bronze medalist</p>
				<p>Captaining U.S. to gold</p>
				<p>Aly Raisman, the captain of the U.S. women's gymnastics team, surprised the world with a second-place finish in qualificaiton at the London Games, earning a spot in the all-around competition ahead of her teammate, reigning world champion Jordyn Wieber. Regardless of early surprises, the Americans came together to win the United States' first team gold medal since 1996. Raisman went on to compete in the all-around competition where she finished fourth - losing a bronze-medal tiebreak to Russia's Aliya Mustafina.</p>
				<p>First Games</p>
				<p>Raisman will make her Olympic debut in London. She finished third all-around at Trials and first on balance beam and floor to earn her spot on the 2012 team. At 18, she is the oldest member of the U.S. women's squad.</p>
				<p>2011 year of medals</p>
				<p>Raisman began her season at the American Cup, where she finished third behind teammate Jordyn Wieber (gold) and reigning world champion Aliya Mustafina (silver). Raisman competed all-around at the CoverGirl Classic in July and took home the title, despite struggling on bars at that meet. Weeks later at Nationals, she hit four-for-four both nights of competition to win her second national all-around medal, a bronze. At Worlds in Tokyo, Raisman was the motivational leader after Alicia Sacramone was injured. Raisman rallied the young U.S. womenâ€™s team and they took home the gold medal. With an impressive fourth place result in the individual all-around, days later Raisman claimed her first individual world medal with a bronze on floor exercise.</p>
				<p>Mini-me</p>
				<p>As evident in their powerful style of gymnastics, Raisman trains alongside 2008 Olympian Alicia Sacramone. They are coached by Mihai Brestyan outside of Boston. Of their relationship Raisman says, "She's kind of like my older sister. I can ask her about anything because I know that she's been through it all. She knows what it takes to get there, so watching her work so hard in the gym everyday is really helpful. I love watching her because she's such a beautiful gymnast, she's so powerful, and has the whole package."</p>
				<p>Similar strengths</p>
				<p>Like training-mate Alicia Sacramone, Raisman is a strong on beam, vault, and floor, but struggles on bars.</p>
				<p>Reliable Raisman</p>
				<p>She brings consistency to the U.S. team. In her first year senior she avoided major mistakes in her international debut season to consistently finish on the podium. Raisman won silver medals in the all-around at both the 2010 American Cup and Pacific Rim Championships. She won the bronze medal  in the all-around at the 2010 VISA Championships and qualified for the all-around final at her first world championships.</p>
				<p>Her start</p>
				<p>Raisman's mom competed in high school gymnastics and wanted her to try. An energetic toddler, she loved it right away.</p>
				<p>Big sis</p>
				<p>Raisman has three younger siblings, but none of them are gymnasts. In the summer she likes hanging out with them and watching them swim in the family pool. Raisman even helped one of her sisters learn a flip into the pool. Her family has two dogs (maltese).</p>
				<p>Fashion forward</p>
				<p>After her gymnastics career, Raisman would like to be involved in fashion. Her love of clothes can often lead to problems at the airport...on her way to Australia her luggage weighed 67 pounds.</p>
