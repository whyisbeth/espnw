				<h3>Founder & CEO, Stanton & Company, LLC</h3>
				<p>Amy founded Stanton & Company LLC with the belief that there remains untapped potential in the marketing world, particularly in terms of the marketing and promotion of female athletes, lifestyle experts, and women’s brands. Since 2006, when the company opened its doors, Stanton & Company has built a roster of exceptional athletes in various sports as well as various top experts in the health and wellness space. In addition to representation, Stanton & Company consults for various companies and brands in the healthy, active lifestyle space, working to build platforms, content and programs that will create real impact and results. </p>
				<p>Before founding Stanton & Company, Amy served as the first-ever Chief Marketing Officer for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. While at MSLO, Amy focused on creating a unifying brand and marketing strategy, and as part of that process initiated the development of key marketing vehicles for the company, including a new brand identity and advertising campaign. </p>
				<p>Prior to that, Amy was the Director of Marketing & Communications for NYC2012, New York’s Olympic bid, where she developed and executed both the local and international campaigns for this first-ever endeavor. Working with companies in every industry throughout the city, Amy mobilized New York’s creative community and some of the city’s most valuable resources, icons, and VIPs behind the Olympic effort. </p>
				<p>Before NYC2012, Amy worked in account management at advertising agencies including BBDO, JWT and BBH on blue-chip clients including Kodak, Pizza Hut, Lipton, and Axe. </p>
				<p>With an entrepreneurial upbringing, Amy always planned to start her own business and, inspired by her work with athletes during the Olympic bid, recognized an important and underleveraged opportunity to help promote and build the area of women’s sports. As the company has grown, her traditional marketing background and passion for health and wellness have influenced the expansion of the business. </p>
				<p>While Amy’s tennis career never made it past captain of her high school team, she has completed the Boston to New York AIDS ride twice, dabbled in triathlons, and has completed five marathons.</p>
