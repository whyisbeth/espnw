				<h3>Endowed Chair and Director, DeVos Sports Business Management Program</h3>
				<p>Human rights activist, pioneer for racial equality, internationally recognized expert on sports issues, scholar and author Richard E. Lapchick is often described as “the racial conscience of sport.”  He brought his commitment to equality and his belief that sport can be an effective instrument of positive social change to the University of Central Florida where he accepted an endowed chair in August 2001.  Lapchick became the only person named as “One of the 100 Most Powerful People in Sport” to head up a sport management program.  He remains President and CEO of the National Consortium for Academics and Sport and helped bring the NCAS national office to UCF.  </p>
				<p>The DeVos Sport Business Management Program at UCF is a landmark program that focuses on the business skills necessary for graduates to conduct a successful career in the rapidly changing and dynamic sports industry.  In following with Lapchick’s tradition of human rights activism, the curriculum includes courses with an emphasis on diversity, community service and philanthropy, sport and social issues and ethics in addition to UCF’s strong business curriculum.   The DeVos Program has been named one of the nation’s top five programs by the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and ESPN The Magazine.  In 2009 it was named the nation’s top MBA program for service. In 2011 it was named as one of the 20 organizations that have most affected fair play in America.</p>
				<p>In December of 2006, Lapchick, his wife and daughter and a group of DeVos students formed the Hope for Stanley Foundation which is organizing groups of student-athletes and sports management students to go to New Orleans to work in the reconstruction efforts in the devastated Ninth Ward.  As of the spring of 2011, Hope for Stanley members have spent 33 weeks in the city in a partnership with the NOLA City Council.  Lapchick was named an honorary citizen by the New Orleans City Council in October 2007.</p>
				<p>Lapchick helped found the Center for the Study of Sport in Society in 1984 at Northeastern University.  He served as Director for 17 years and is now the Director Emeritus.  The Center has attracted national attention to its pioneering efforts to ensure the education of athletes from junior high school through the professional ranks.  The Center's Project TEAMWORK was called "America's most successful violence prevention program" by public opinion analyst Lou Harris.  It won the Peter F. Drucker Foundation Award as the nation's most innovative non-profit program and was named by the Clinton Administration as a model for violence prevention.  The Center and the National Consortium for Academics and Sports created the MVP gender violence prevention program that has been so successful with college and high school athletes that all branches of the United States military have adopted it.</p>
				<p>Lapchick also helped form the NCAS in 1985.  It is a group of over 230 colleges and universities that created the first of its kind degree completion and community service programs.
