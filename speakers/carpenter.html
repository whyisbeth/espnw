				<h3>President, Burton Snowboards</h3>
				<p>Donna Carpenter and her husband Jake Burton Carpenter are the sole owners of Burton Snowboards, the world’s leading snowboard company. Donna and Jake also own Burton’s family of boardsports brands, which includes Channel Islands Surfboards, ANON Optics, RED, The Program, Analog Clothing and Gravis Footwear. </p>
				<p>Since 1982, Donna has held a multitude of roles at Burton, which originally operated out of her Vermont barn and now has offices in Vermont, Japan, Austria, California and Australia. During the past three decades, she has built snowboards, answered phones, expanded Burton’s market to Europe and held the CFO position. </p>
				<p>Now, Donna has taken on even more responsibilities as the President of Burton, assuming leadership of the company’s international business as well as its global human resources. Donna is also heading up the non-profit Chill Foundation, which she and Jake founded back in 1995 to bring snowboarding to youth who otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity. In addition, Donna continues to oversee all efforts to ensure that Burton is an employer and brand of choice for women. Through Donna’s leadership, Burton established new women’s marketing, product and creative initiatives to drive the women’s business and created internal programs that focus on retaining and promoting women. </p>
				<p>On top of all this, Donna snowboards and spends time with her three sons and Jake as much as possible.</p>
