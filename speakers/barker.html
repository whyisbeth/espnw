				<h3>MSW, founded Girls on the Run</h3>
				<p>Molly Barker, MSW, founded Girls on the Run in 1996 in Charlotte, North Carolina. A four-time Hawaii Ironman triathlete, she used her background in social work, counseling and teaching, along with research on adolescent issues, to develop the program. Today, there are Girls on the Run councils in 202 cities across North America serving over 160,000 girls and women each year. (<a href="http://www.girlsontherun.org" rel="external" target="_blank">www.girlsontherun.org</a>)</p>
				<p>The “Girl Box,” a phrase coined by Molly, describes the imaginary place many girls go around adolescence, where cultural and societal stereotypes limit choices as well as opportunities. Starting with this strong foundation, Molly’s idea is, through a variety of targeted and innovative curriculum-driven projects as well as thought-provoking dialogue to create a social movement, which provides girls and women with the tools and the courage to see, unravel from and eliminate their own and often unconscious buy-in to the Girl Box and its limiting messages.  </p>
				<p>Molly is fast becoming a well-known social entrepreneur who creates innovative and “break-through” experiences to shift perceptions around gender, beauty and power, to fuel the women’s self-liberation movement and hence create a world where girls and women can boldly pursue their dreams and activate their greatest potential.</p>
				<p>Molly has been featured in many media outlets including People, Runner’s World, Glamour, Self, Shape, Redbook and Woman’s Day. Molly has authored  two  books,  “Girls  on  Track, A  Parent’s  Guide  to  Inspiring  our  Daughters  to  Achieve  a  Lifetime  of Self-Esteem and Respect”, and “Girls Lit from Within” which is specifically for 3rd – 8th grade girls. </p>
				<p>Molly is a positive role model for girls and women of all ages. She enjoys writing, running and yoga but most enjoys the challenges which emerge in her own personal evolution and deep desire to live life outside the Girl Box.</p>
