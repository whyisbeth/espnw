				<h3>Global Brand Strategy, Twitter</h3>
				<p>Josh Grau leads Global Brand Strategy at Twitter, where he oversees creative and strategic partnerships with the world's top brands in the US, Latin American, and Asian markets.  In addition to working with advertisers, he develops integrated marketing partnerships with media companies, publishers and talent, including directing the ESPN/Twitter relationship.  Prior to Twitter he was at Google where he helped build YouTube's first marketing solutions team, as well as started the branded entertainment group which evolved into the current Original Channels platform.  Before Google he was a Director of Marketing at ESPN, building integrated campaigns for brands across ESPN's multimedia properties.  While media has been his primary professional focus, he also spent six seasons as a Division 1 women's volleyball coach, with stops at the University of Texas (1998-99) and Northwestern University (2000-04) where he led both programs into the NCAA post-season tournament.  He holds a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Florida, a master's in Sports Management from the University of Texas, and master's in Integrated Marketing from Northwestern, where he was also an adjunct professor in the Sports Administration master's program for five years.</p>
