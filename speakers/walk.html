				<h3>General Manager, Giant Bicycle, Inc.</h3>
				<p>Recognized as an “inspiration for women in the biycle industry” and a “breath of fresh air”, Elysa Walk joined the bicycle industry in 2004 with Giant Bicycle, Inc.  Prior to that, she worked in the software industry as an Operations Manager, running the operations of a fast growing telecommunications management software company for 10 years.  </p>
				<p>Elysa took full responsibility for "Giant USA" as General Manager in 2007.  Since that time, she has grown the company by forty percent, and has launched many ground-breaking initiatives, such as a women’s specific bicycle brand called Liv, and "The Link” annual Giant dealer convention.  She is known for making Giant a great place to work and fostering a coveted employee culture.</p>
				<p>Elysa serves on the boards of Bikes Belong and the Bicycle Product Suppliers Association.  She is an advisor to the newly launched Women Bike program.  Together with the League of American Bicyclists, this program works to empower more women to bicycle and become engaged in the diverse leadership opportunities of the bicycle movement. </p>
				<p>While a graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Business Management from the University of Southern California and an MBA from Pepperdine University, Elysa is first and foremost a cyclist of all kinds.  She can often be found riding roads, cross-country mountain trails, gravity parks, or just her local commute.  She completed the Tour de Taiwan, a 600-mile ride around the island of Taiwan with the Giant executive team in 2011, and regularly participates in Giant-sponsored triathlons or charity rides.  Elysa has a bicycle family, and is regularly riding with her husband and two teenage children.</p>
