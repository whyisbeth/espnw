				<h3>Director, Magic Bus USA</h3>
				<p>Since its establishment in 2010, Rahul Brahmbhatt manages Magic Bus USA, the US sustainability arm of one of the largest sport for development NGOs in the world.</p>
				<p>The road here was a winding one filled with adventure.  After completing his studies at the University of Texas in Chemical Engineering, Rahul worked in various capacities in the energy, oil, gas and water/wastewater sectors as an engineer, project manager, and sales manager, traveling extensively to the Far East, India, and Mexico.  Enjoying the travel and exploration, but realizing that his true passions lay elsewhere, he decided to “start over” in 2008.</p>
				<p>Rahul spent the next year at George Mason University, earning a degree in Sport Management and conducting research on the history and current state of basketball in India.  He interned with the Washington Redskins in their Community Relations and Charitable Foundation, and worked on special projects for USA Football and the Nike/Ashoka “Changing the Game for Women” Gamechangers competition.  </p>
				<p>In 2009, Rahul then embarked on a life-changing one year journey to India as an Indicorps Fellow.  He spent one year living in urban slum and village India with families living under the poverty line while undertaking a full-immersion approach to grassroots development.  Rahul’s project was to harness the power of sport as a catalyst for personal and community growth, using Ultimate Frisbee as the engagement mechanism.  Capitalizing on the fact that Ultimate is low-cost, non-contact, and self-refereed, the program grew from 30 children to more than 200 in the course of a year.  Rahul and his team developed educational curricula and experiential learning modules that were implemented in leadership training seminars for teachers and principals at schools across the Indian state of Gujarat.  In 2009, he helped organize the inaugural Ahmedabad Ultimate Open, a national Ultimate tournament that has found its way into the annual national tournament circuit in India.  In addition to learning more about the power of sport, Rahul experienced firsthand the compassion, drive, and ingenuity of the families and communities with which he lived and the real-life issues faced by those living below the poverty line.  Of all the takeaways, the lack of opportunity for women and girls is the one that is the one that stays with him the strongest to this day.</p>
