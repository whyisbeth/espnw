				<h3>Ph.D. L.M.T.</h3>
				<p>Felice is an Australian from Monbulk, Vic. She is a soigneur, massage therapist and physiologist. Dr. Beitzel completed her bachelor’s degree in Science with Honours in Physiology at the University of Melbourne in 2002. In 2007, she completed her doctorate in muscle physiology under the guidance of Professor Gordon Lynch in the Basic and Clinical Myology Laboratory at the University of Melbourne. Dr. Beitzel’s research focused on muscle repair after injury with particular focus on adrenergic signalling in regenerating muscles. Her doctoral work received national and international recognition, earning a number of prestigious awards and resulting in publications in leading physiology journals. During this time she also completed her massage therapy training at the Australian Institute of Massage in Melbourne. </p>
				<p>In 2008, Felice relocated to USA to pursue her passion for cross-country ski racing, where she joined XC Oregon ski team based in Bend - a town called home by many elite athletes. She was soon recruited to join Giant Bicycles Mountain Bike Team as the soigneur and has since spent summers travelling to international cycling events. She has also served as a USOC volunteer sports medicine staff member at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, CA, and at the 2011 Pan American Games, Mexico. </p>
				<p>In 2012, Felice is working for a company called Performance Driven, owned by the 2011 USOC National Coach of the Year - USA Cycling BMX Coach, James Herrera. With Performance Driven, she works with Team USA athletes in BMX, track cycling, and mountain biking, and the Giant Factory Off-Road Mountain Bike Team at training camps, World Cups, World Championships and the Olympic Games in London.</p>
				<p>Felice thoroughly enjoys the challenges presented by travelling and working in different countries. She likes that her job allows her to combine her massage therapy skills, physiology knowledge and experiences in elite sport, and is particularly interested in recovery physiology. In her spare time when not cooking for hungry athletes, cross country skiing, or riding bikes, Felice enjoys volunteering for health initiatives such as assisting the School Food Tour – a program involving a nation wide bicycle tour to advocate for better nutrition and active lifestyles for school students.</p>
