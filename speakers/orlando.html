				<h3>Senior Vice President, Talent Development & Planning</h3>
				<p>Laurie Orlando joined ESPN as senior vice president, talent development and planning in January 2008.  In this newly created position, Orlando oversees ESPN's new Talent Office and relationships with the on-air personalities who represent the ESPN brand across all multimedia platforms.  Orlando is focused on three primary areas -- negotiation and facilitation of contracts; identification and recruitment of new talent; and establishing development, communication, coaching and feedback processes.  She works hand-in-hand with ESPN’s studio, event, news, international, radio, new media, ESPN.com, content development and Magazine management teams.</p>
				<p> This is the second ESPN stint for Orlando, who worked for ESPN Classic as a coordinating producer in 1999.  In her earlier role, Orlando oversaw the development, supervision and execution of all original, documentary and long-form programming, including the Sweet Science documentary series and other critically-acclaimed original programs.  </p>
				<p>Most recently, Orlando was the senior vice president, executive producer for MSG & Fox Sports New York (Sept. 2006 – Dec. ‘07), and before that she spent nearly five years (Nov. 2002 – Aug. ’06) at College Sports Television (CSTV) as vice president of programming, original programming and development and vice president of remote & feature production.</p>
				<p>Orlando has held significant production and programming roles at multiple networks throughout her career, and she has developed a reputation throughout the industry as a creative executive who thrives on the challenge of building networks from their inception, having played an integral role in start-up teams that launched five networks -- The Comedy Channel (1989), Classic Sports Network (1994), Oxygen Media (1999), CSTV (2003), and The Mtn (2006), all of which remain on the air in some form.</p>
				<p>Orlando has exhibited a passion for sports throughout her professional career, beginning with her early experience as a freelance producer for Showtime’s Championship Boxing coverage (Jan. 1991-July ’96).  She joined Classic Sports Network in 1996 as a coordinating producer responsible for development and execution of the network's boxing programming and original programming, and she also supervised original studio production for all sports genres.</p>
				<p>Following ESPN Classic, Orlando was named the supervising producer for Oxygen Sports, where she was responsible for the highly acclaimed twice-weekly one-hour original women's sports program, a series of 13 sports biographies and the network’s first season of WNBA games.  She also directed production of programming on a global basis.</p>
				<p> A native of Scotia, N.Y., Orlando graduated from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Science degree in International Relations, as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Television and Film Writing from the University's Newhouse School of Public Communications.  She began her career in television in 1980, serving as a news intern with WRGB TV in Albany, N.Y.  In 1986 she interned on Late Night With David Letterman before moving onto positions with Showtime and HBO’s Comedy Channel.  A resident of Fairfield, Conn., Orlando remains actively involved in the Syracuse University, Newhouse School Alumni Advisory Program, a member of the Advisory Board for the Falk School of Sport Management at Syracuse University, a member of the Advisory Board for Global Girl Media, a charter member of Women in Sports and Events and a member of the New York Chapter of WICT. </p>
				<p>In her free time, Orlando enjoys spending time with family and friends, yoga, cycling, soccer, the Yankees, music, reading, cooking, traveling and wine!</p>
