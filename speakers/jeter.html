				<h3>THREE-TIME OLYMPIC MEDALIST <br/>
					TRACK & FIELD WORLD CHAMPION<br/>
					FASTEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD</h3>
				<p>Carmelita “The Jet” Jeter, the fastest woman alive, just finished her third straight season as the top American sprinter with three Olympic medals and a new world record: 100m (Silver), 200m (Bronze) and 4x100m relay (Gold). </p>
				<p>Born and raised in Southern California, Carmelita got her athletic start in basketball; it wasn’t until high school that she found her love for speed. Basketball was the preferred sport in Carmelita’s family- her younger brother, Eugene, later joined the Sacramento Kings. </p>
				<p>During her freshman year of high school, Carmelita’s basketball coach suggested that she try out for track to help keep in shape in off-season. Not only did Carmelita show up to tryouts wearing basketball high-top sneakers and basketballs shorts, she also ran an 11.7 second 100m in them, proving her natural talent for sprinting.</p>
				<p>Upon graduating high school, Carmelita signed on with California State University, Dominguez Hills track team and became the University’s first U.S. Olympic trials qualifier. Carmelita went on to become the most decorated track & field athlete in the history of the school. While at Dominguez Hills, Carmelita also excelled off the track and acquired a degree in physical education. </p>
				<p>2007, Carmelita’s first year on the professional track and field circuit, she not only took home her first medal in 100m at her first World Championships, she also set a then personal record with a time of 11.05. In the same season, Carmelita won a silver medal in the 60m at the USA Track and Field Indoor Championships and set another personal best with a time of 7.17 seconds. </p>
				<p>After the 2008 season, Carmelita changed her coach, deciding to work with John Smith who had previously coached Olympic champion, Maurice Greene. Carmelita’s new coach began to completely remodel her running style, thus preparing her for greater success. </p>
				<p>After the 2009 World Championships, Carmelita entered the IAAF World Athletics Final having won her last three races by a significant margin. She not only won the 100m, with a time of 10.67, but she also became the third fastest woman in history and set a championship record. This was the fastest 100m time in 12 years, a time which had only been bettered by Florence Griffith-Joyner.</p>
				<p>Carmelita proved herself to be the best once again by setting a new personal best with a time of 10.64, making her the second fastest woman ever.</p>
				<p>In 2011, Carmelita took home two gold medals in the 100m and the 4x100m relay and one silver medal in the 200m at the World Championships in Daegu.</p>
