				<!--<h3>Bio Coming Soon!</h3>-->
				<p>Terra Naomi is one of the greatest artist success stories in YouTube’s history, creating a global Internet-hit with “Say It’s Possible.” Admired by artists around the world, Naomi has toured/performed with The Fray, Martha Wainwright, Tyler Hilton, Sara Bareilles, Corinne Bailey Rae and Natasha Bedingfield.</p>
				<p>Naomi created international attention with her stand-out performance at “Live Earth” with Al Gore at Wembley Stadium. Terra’s debut album, ‘Under The Influence,’ was released in the UK by Universal Island Records in November 2007. Her follow-up album, ‘To Know I’m Ok,’ was produced by John Alagia (the producer of John Mayer, Dave Matthews Band and Jason Mraz), and her album 'Live & Unplugged,' recorded during her January/February 2012 European Tour, will be released in October. </p>
				<p>Terra has circumvented traditional music distribution and promotion methods, forming strategic partnerships with Hipstamatic, YouTube, Ustream, Klout, 1Band1Brand, Bedell Guitars, influential technology companies and iPhone app developers, and popular hotel chains to release and promote her music.</p>
				<p>With 21,000,000+ YouTube views, 2,750,000+ plays, 1.2MM fans on Google+, and strong global followings on Facebook and Twitter, Terra’s audience and reach continue to grow.</p>
				<p>Songs can be heard on MTV’s “Road Rules” and “Junior Year Abroad,” Fox’s “American Idol,” a plethora of other hit series and award-winning documentaries, and commercial ad campaigns, like Coldwater Creek.</p>
				<p>Songs in recent films include Golden Globe nominated “Sherrybaby” (starring Maggie Gyllenhaal), Super (starring Liz Tyler, Rainn Wilson and Ellen Paige),  the pre-show National Geographic photo exhibition for Paramount Picture’s “Life In A Day,” “Because I Said So,” starring Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore, “Faces in the Crowd,” starring Mila Jovovich, and many more.</p>
