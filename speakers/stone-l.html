				<h3>10-year-old Golf Phenom</h3>
				<p>Latanna Stone is a 10-year-old golf phenom who has already set her sights high and is well on her way towards accomplishing her goals by becoming the youngest player to ever qualify for the USGA Women’s Amateur Tournament at the age of ten. Latanna’s father, Michael Stone, says she was just two years old when she took the club away from him and took a giant swing – a swing that to this day simply amazes him. Latanna’s age alone proves that she has an all-natural, god-given talent and that her mechanics simply cannot be taught. Latanna has already won over 95 tournaments, in just 6 short years of competition. Stone regularly trains at River Hills Country Club and has frequent sessions with her coach, Charlotta Sorenstam, in Orlando. For the first time, she is being home-schooled by her mother, working at the third-grade level, and structuring academics around her golf schedule. While it's incredible to witness Latanna stripe a 180-yard drive down the middle, it can be said that her beautiful golf swing takes a back seat to her personality. She is mature beyond her years. She is confident, smart, witty, humble, polite and she loves to win! When not swinging a golf club, Latanna loves spending her free time singing, dancing, going to the movies and playing with her two dogs Sandy and Cinnamon Buns. Besides being an accomplished golfer, Latanna has also been featured in national ad campaigns for Kenneth Cole Reaction and Linen Source.
